# C projects

These are projects I did for subject "Principles of low-level programming".

<ul>
<li>HW01: Programmer calculator</li>
<li>HW02: Minesweeper</li>
<li>HW03: Network traffic analyzer</li>
<li>HW04: Xpath</li>
<li>HW05: Permission check.</li>
</ul>

I am most proud of HW03 and HW05, we had roughly one and half weeks to complete each project, so they are not perfect. Assignments were graded by unit, and integration tests were not visible to us. Some functions were premade or poorly implemented by teachers, and we could use them after revision and correction.
