# C projects

These are projects I did for subject "Principles of low-level programming".

<ul>
<li>HW01: Programmer calculator</li>
<li>HW02: Minesweeper</li>
<li>HW03: Network traffic analyzer</li>
<li>HW04: Xpath</li>
<li>HW05: Permission check.</li>
</ul>
I'm most proud of HW03 and HW05, we had about a week and a half for each project, so they're not perfect. The assignments were graded using unit and integration tests, the design of which we didn't see. Some features were pre-made or poorly implemented by teachers and we were only able to use them after revising and correcting.
